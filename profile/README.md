Ebiose is an open-source project creating a distributed AI ecosystem of autonomous agents that self-improve.

It helps you build complex custom agents.

</br>
It uses the concept of architect agents to pick and configure the right models and components for your specific use case.

These architects possess the ability to self-improve through evolutionary principles.

</br>
Our vision: an open ecosystem where everyone participates in building the models and agents of tomorrow.
